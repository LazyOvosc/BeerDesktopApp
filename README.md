# SipBiteUnite

SipBiteUnite is a project to help people find the best pair of food and beer. It will have a beer catalog, a food catalog, and a rating system for each pair of food and beer.

## Requirements

* **Beer catalog:** The beer catalog should include information about different types of beer, such as brand, style, ABV, and IBU. It should also include information about where to buy each beer, such as online retailers and local stores.
* **Food catalog:** The food catalog should include information about different types of food, such as cuisine, dish name, ingredients, and calories. It should also include information about where to order each food, such as delivery apps and restaurants.
* **Rating system:** The rating system should allow users to rate each pair of food and beer. This will help other users to find the best pairs of food and beer.
* **Food delivery integration:** The project should be integrated with food delivery apps, such as Uber Eats and DoorDash. This will allow users to automatically create orders for the food that they want to eat.

## Future plans

* **Recommendations:** The project could recommend pairs of food and beer to users based on their preferences. For example, it could recommend a pair of food and beer for a specific occasion, such as a birthday party or a picnic.
* **Social features:** The project could allow users to share their favorite pairs of food and beer with their friends and followers. This could help to create a community of people who are passionate about finding the best pairs of food and beer.
